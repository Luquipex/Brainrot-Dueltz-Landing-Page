## Overview

This project is a **Brainrot DUELTZâ„¢** collectible card game landing page built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. The application is designed as both a full-stack application with backend capabilities and a deployable frontend-only version for platforms like Vercel.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and effects
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture (Optional)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with TypeScript

### Build Configuration
- **Development**: Hot reload via Vite dev server on port 5000
- **Production**: Static build to `dist` directory with optional Express server
- **Deployment**: Multiple deployment strategies (Vercel, traditional hosting)

## Key Components

### Core Pages
- **Home Page**: Main landing page with all sections
- **404 Page**: Not found error page

### UI Sections
1. **Navbar**: Fixed navigation with smooth scrolling to sections
2. **Hero Section**: Main branding and call-to-action with animated backgrounds

8. **Footer**: Site navigation and social links

### Data Layer
- **Card Data**: Static card information with multilingual support
- **Game Data**: Rules, social links, and game mechanics
- **Translations**: Centralized text content for internationalization

## Data Flow

### Static Content Flow
1. Static data imported from TypeScript modules
2. Components consume data through direct imports
3. No external API calls for basic functionality
4. All content is bundled at build time

### Interactive Features
1. Form submissions handled via React Hook Form
2. Animations triggered by Framer Motion
3. Smooth scrolling managed by native browser APIs
4. Newsletter signup ready for backend integration

### Database Integration (When Enabled)
1. Drizzle ORM handles database schema and queries
2. PostgreSQL stores user sessions and potential game data
3. Connect-pg-simple manages session persistence
4. API endpoints provide data to frontend via TanStack Query
